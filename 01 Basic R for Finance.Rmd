# R Basic

## Working with Matrix
We can create matrix from one atomic vector.
```{r}
x_vec <- c(9, 4, 6, 20, 19, 29)
x_mat <- matrix(data = x_vec, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
x_mat

cor(x_mat)
```

We can also create matrix from 2 vectors.
```{r}
y_vec = rnorm(6, 23, 98)

matrix_yx <- cbind(x_vec, y_vec)
matrix_yx

cor(matrix_yx)
```

## Working with DataFrame

```{r}
cash_flow <- rnorm(10, 4, 9)
year <- runif(10, 5, 45)
company <- c("Google", "Google", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Apple", "Google", "Google", "Microsoft", "Microsoft")
company_data <- data.frame(company, cash_flow, year)
company_data

# sub-setting the DF
company_data[1:3,1, drop=FALSE]
company_data$cash_flow
subset(company_data, cash_flow < 6.00)

# Delete a column
company_data$year = NULL
company_data
```
## Working with Factor
```{r}
# Factor will make R treat string as integer.
investment <- c("stock", "bonds", "stock", "bonds", "stock")
investment_factor <- factor(investment)
# Summary of factor is more informative.
summary(investment)
summary(investment_factor)
# Change the levels.
investment
levels(investment) <- c("B", "S")
investment

# cut() will factoring the numbers based on interval.
price <- runif(100, 20, 100)
breaks <- c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
ranking_grouped <- cut(price, breaks = breaks)
head(ranking_grouped)
levels(ranking_grouped) <- c("very_low", "low", "medium", "high", "very_high")
# Plot the factor
plot(ranking_grouped)
```
